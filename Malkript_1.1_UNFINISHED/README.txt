This malware is coded fully in C#, and the MBR in Assembly (made by MalwareLab)
This malware runs on Windows XP and 7, running it on other OS will fuck your OS instantly.
When running on unsupported OS, it has a different MBR, thanks to MalwareLab for the beep.
You need .NET Framework 4 to execute it
This malware will:
 - Overwrite MBR
 - Destroy registry HKCR
 - Destroy HKCU
 - Delete System32
