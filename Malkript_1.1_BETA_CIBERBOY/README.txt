This malware is coded fully in C#, and the MBR in Assembly (thanks to CYBER SOLDIER for MBR tutorial)
This malware runs best on Windows XP and Windows 7
You need .NET Framework 4 to execute it
On newer OSes it might feel laggy and payloads don't appear correctly.
This malware created by CiberBoy can harm your PC and render your data and partitions unusable.
This malware will:
 - Overwrite MBR
 - Destroy registry HKCR
 - Destroy HKCU
 - Destroy the BCD
 - Destroy windows bootmgr
 - Move the desktop icons
I'm also working on file encryption
This malware was intended to be used on a Virtual Machine under a safe environment.

Without you this wouldn't have been possible!

What else to say?
This malware took me almost 1 month and half to make and a week of bugfixing.

Take care y'all
